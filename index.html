            <p>The United States is a vast and diverse country with 50 states, spanning from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It was founded in 1776 after declaring independence from Great Britain and has since become a global economic and cultural powerhouse. The U.S. is known for its democratic government, which operates under the Constitution, one of the oldest functioning written constitutions in the world. With a rich history of immigration, innovation, and social change, the country continues to evolve in politics, technology, and culture.</p>
